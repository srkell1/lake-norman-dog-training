Here's a draft privacy policy tailored for the Lake Norman Dog Training website. The policy explains what information is collected, how it’s used, cookie practices, data security, children’s privacy and contact details. It references authoritative sources such as the U.S. Data.gov privacy policy to justify the statements—like the fact that websites typically log IP addresses and use cookies for navigation and analytics, that personal information is only used to respond to inquiries, and that security measures and external links are handled responsibly. It also adapts these principles to your site’s specific contact form fields and contact details. You’ll find the full policy in the attached file.

To add this policy to your site:

1. Create a new page in your project named `privacy-policy.html` and paste the contents of the attached policy.
2. Update the “Privacy Policy” text in your footer (e.g., `index.html`, `pages/404.html`, etc.) to link to the new page. From the root `index.html`, the link should be `<a href="pages/privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>`, whereas pages within the `pages` folder should link with `<a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>`.
3. Deploy the updated site.

If you need help integrating these changes into the repository, let me know and I’ll guide you through the steps. The file with the full policy is available here: {{file\:file-79bzbwuA2moGKWQp2qFAZL}}.
